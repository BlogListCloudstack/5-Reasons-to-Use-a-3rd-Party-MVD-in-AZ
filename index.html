            <p>
                As of 2019, there were more than <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2019/dl1c.cfm">5.3 million</a> licensed drivers in the state of Arizona. If you need driver services, you should consider visiting a 3rd party MVD location.
            </p>
            <p>
                While a 1st party MVD location offers all of the services you need as a driver in Arizona, the experience often leaves a lot to be desired. Fortunately, 3rd party MVD service providers exist in the state and give drivers more options for getting services in an efficient and convenient way.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this article, we’ll list the top reasons why you should consider using third party MVD services.

            <h2>What Are 3rd Party Motor Vehicle Services?</h2>
            <p>
                An <a href="https://azdot.gov/motor-vehicles/professional-services/authorized-third-party-services">Authorized Third Party</a> (ATP) office is run by a private company that is contracted by Arizona’s Motor Vehicle Division (MVD).
            </p>
            <p>
                These companies offer all MVD services on behalf of the MVD and will typically be more convenient for drivers. Third-party MVD services tend to be less crowded, more efficient, and offer more extensive service hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                In many cases, it’s a much better choice to visit a third-party MVD location instead of a typical MVD field office.
            </p>

            <h2>Top 5 Reasons to Use a 3rd Party MVD</h2>
            <p>
                So what are the top benefits of using a 3rd party MVD? Here are some of the top things to consider.
            </p>
            <h3 style="padding-top: 30px;">1. Skip The Wait</h3>
            <p>
                One of the top reasons to use third-party MVD services is that they’ll be faster and more efficient than a regular motor vehicle services location. While regular MVD offices can be surprisingly slow at times, a reliable third-party MVD services provider such as GG&D will work much more efficiently and help you get the service you need in record time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you need to transfer a title, renew a registration, or obtain a temporary permit, you’ll find that service is fast and friendly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Going to a third-party MVD near you can be well worth it and can allow you to meet all of your driving service needs in a short time frame. If you have questions, friendly representatives can answer them quickly and help you find the information you’re looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you simply don’t have much time in your schedule, then you may want to consider going to a third-party MVD in Arizona.
            </p>
            <h3 style="padding-top: 30px;">2. Same Day Processing</h3>
            <p>
                Not only will the services at third-party MVD providers be fast and efficient, but you’ll also find that they’ll offer same-day processing for many services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because operations are so streamlined, you’ll be able to go into a third-party MVD and get the services you need immediately. You won’t need to spend a lot of time waiting for processing. You can walk into an MVD services location without scheduling an appointment and can get in and out in a short amount of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                In many cases, because processing can happen the same day you walk in, so you won’t need to make extra trips or wait for anything in the mail. This will be more convenient for you and can be very helpful if you need driver services fast.
            </p>
            <h3 style="padding-top: 30px;">3. Longer Hours</h3>
            <p>
                While Arizona MVD locations tend to be open fairly late, they only open once or twice a week. Fortunately, 3rd party MVDs in Arizona tend to offer hours that are more reasonable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Great 3rd party MVD service options have hours that are much more convenient for the average driver. For example, the hours for our MVD services and driver’s license services are currently from 8:00 am and 7:00 pm on Monday through Friday and between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm on Saturday.
            </p>
            <p>
                With these extended hours on each weekday, you’ll be able to get driver’s license services and other MVD services at a time that’s the most convenient for you, such as before or after work. You won’t have to tweak your schedule or make major changes to get the services you need from a third-party MVD location.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3 style="padding-top: 30px;">4. Open on Weekends</h3>
            <p>
                As mentioned above, 3rd party MVD offices also offer weekend hours to drivers. This means that if you’re currently very busy during the week, you won’t have to stress out about fitting in a trip to an MVD services location.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead, you can go to a third-party MVD location and meet all of your needs. You can get vehicle inspections, title transfers, title and tag renewals, and <a href="https://www.ggandd.com/arizona-mvd-services/driver-licenses-ids/">driver’s license and ID</a> needs taken care of on the weekend when you don’t have other responsibilities to worry about such as work or school. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This can be more convenient for you and can allow you to get the services you need without trying to fit a visit into a busy weekday schedule.
            </p>
            <h3 style="padding-top: 30px;">5. Less People</h3>
            <p>
                Another great reason to go to a third-party MVD is that it will be less crowded. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It can be unpleasant sitting in a muggy, crowded room and waiting for your turn at a regular MVD office. When going to a third-party MVD instead, you will be more comfortable and relaxed as you wait for your turn to speak to a representative.
            </p>
            <p>
                MVD service locations such as those at GG&D offer comfortable seating and spacious waiting areas. You’ll feel at ease as you wait to get services for your driving needs. However, you likely won’t be late waiting long at a third-party MVD anyway, since the service will be so fast and efficient.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>Making the Choice to Use Third Party MVD Services</h2>
            <p>
                If you’re looking for driver services in Arizona, you should consider using third party MVD services instead of visiting a standard MVD office.
            </p>
            <p>
                By doing so, you’ll be able to get the services you need more quickly and at a more convenient time. You’ll also avoid crowds and long waits as well.
